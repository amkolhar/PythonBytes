Hi, I am Atharv.  I started learning coding as a hobby and now I am working in the Software Industry as a Software Engineer with a background in SW Testing. I am located in Silicon Valley and have been working in the industry for the last 5 years. 

Welcome to the video series of Python Bytes. I will be uploading videos on Python Coding and problem-solving.
I would love to interact with the python community and start discussions related to python. Please join the Discord Server for Python Bytes.
